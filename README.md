## The problem

A scientific Iot platform is needed to execute and automate laboratory experiments that invloves instrument data.

## The solution

So i created a simple react application that can be used by scientist to experiment a hypothesis and if the testable data that was provided is consistant with the hypothesis, then we will have to run the software again for five time to check if the results are still the same then we will declare we have a scientific theory. 

### Tools i used

- React 
- Redux 
- React-router-dom 
- node-sass("I prefer it over old style vanilla CSS")
- useCookies
- local storage (But i might remove it during refactoring) etc

### What i didn't do

- I didn't use any CSS framework (Personally, I love the creativity and flexibility just CSS gives when building app. So if there's time, i love to build the CSS from ground up else i will use Tailwind CSS)

- The code might not be the best optimised but when given enough time, i will refactor my code untill i'm proud to show someone.

### Process

- The app opens with a request for the user to provide an observation and a testable hypothesis, if the user didn't provide any of those data, a popup will appear and remind them.
- Now the user is in second page, this page has a lot of features namely:
- - It shows an animated vitual scientific process to enable the users understand the current stage of their experiment
- - Under the scientific process, we have a section that discribes what is happening above it.
- - Then we have a button a user can use to change the way the visualise the scientific process in another style
- - We also have a way a user can update the data the provided before, this will only be done if the predication is false, and then i made the app (Just for the purpose of giving idea) in such a way that if water is not contained in the hythosis, the prediction will be false.
- - A beautiful looking UI will also tell a user that the result of the predication is consistant with the  hypthosis, it will also ask the user if the want to allow the result to be tested five times more to be very certian or not now option.
- - A feature i didn't implement is to save that proven scientific theory to the books of theory data list.

### Questions
- I didn't understand alot of things in the Calibration SOP pdf
- I don't understand yet how the hypothesis can be collected in a real word situation and put into a technology, i guess is done using Iot but i don't know how.
- I didn't ask my questions earlier because, from the code challange pdf, i saw that i have less or equal to 8 hours to do the test, so i decided to ask after. Normally, i will ask before i start the project.


## Conclusion
This is the second time i'm using a markdown to write something, the first time i did it was when i was learning to write notes online instead of always looking the pen, i hate that part. You can see the thing i wrote if you like [my first markdown note](https://sylvasblog.com/). Had to get that out of my chest because i don't know how well this my makedown read me will go.
